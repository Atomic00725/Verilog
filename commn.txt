1. I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
Type: Serial, synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave bus

Use case: Short-distance communication between microcontrollers and peripherals like sensors, EEPROMs, ADCs.

How it works: Uses two wires—SDA (data line) and SCL (clock line). Devices share these lines and use unique addresses to communicate.

Why: It allows multiple devices on the same bus without complex wiring, making it ideal for embedded systems needing simple, low-speed connections.

2. SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
Type: Serial, synchronous, full-duplex, master-slave

Use case: Faster communication than I2C, used for displays, memory chips, and sensors.

How it works: Uses 4 lines: MOSI (Master Out Slave In), MISO (Master In Slave Out), SCLK (clock), and SS/CS (slave select). Data flows simultaneously in both directions.

Why: Its speed and full-duplex nature make it suitable for high-performance, short-distance peripheral communication.

3. UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)
Type: Serial, asynchronous

Use case: Common for PC to microcontroller communication, GPS modules, Bluetooth modules.

How it works: Transmits data serially without a clock line, relying on start/stop bits and fixed baud rates to synchronize sender and receiver.

Why: Simple and widely supported, it allows devices to communicate over longer distances (compared to I2C and SPI) with minimal wiring.

4. CAN Bus (Controller Area Network)
Type: Serial, multi-master, message-based protocol

Use case: Automotive systems, industrial automation.

How it works: Uses two wires (CAN_H and CAN_L) for differential signaling to reduce noise. Nodes communicate by broadcasting messages identified by IDs, allowing high reliability and priority-based messaging.

Why: Designed for harsh environments with lots of electrical noise. Ensures robust and fault-tolerant communication for critical systems like cars’ engine control and safety systems.

5. Modbus (Serial Communication Protocol)
Type: Master-slave, half-duplex serial communication, often over RS485

Use case: Industrial automation, SCADA systems, PLCs.

How it works: Master device queries slave devices by sending commands. Slaves respond with data or status. Modbus defines a simple messaging structure.

Why: Easy to implement and very common in industrial control, Modbus provides interoperability across diverse equipment.

6. RS485
Type: Electrical standard for serial communication

Use case: Long-distance and noise-resistant industrial networks.

How it works: Uses differential signaling over twisted-pair cables to support multiple devices on the same bus (up to 32 nodes).

Why: Its robustness and multi-point capability make it ideal for factory floor and building automation.

7. USB (Universal Serial Bus)
Type: Serial, host-controlled, plug-and-play

Use case: Computers and peripherals (keyboards, mice, storage devices, cameras).

How it works: Provides power and data over a single cable, supports hot-swapping, multiple device types, and high data transfer speeds (varies by USB version).

Why: Standardizes PC peripheral communication with automatic device recognition, power supply, and fast data transfers.

8. Ethernet
Type: Network protocol, wired LAN communication

Use case: Networking computers, IoT devices, industrial Ethernet.

How it works: Uses packet-based communication over twisted-pair or fiber cables, supports very high data rates, and is the foundation of most local area networks.

Why: Enables complex networked systems with scalability, reliability, and integration into the internet.

Summary:
I2C, SPI, UART are mostly for short-range embedded device communication.

CAN Bus, Modbus/RS485 are robust, noise-resistant protocols ideal for automotive and industrial environments.

USB, Ethernet serve higher-level needs for computer peripherals and networking.

Each protocol solves different real-world challenges — from simplicity and low cost to speed, robustness, and scalability — enabling devices to “talk” effectively in embedded, automotive, industrial, and consumer systems.

# Verilog Digital Design Projects

This repository contains a collection of Verilog HDL implementations for various digital circuits and components. Each module is written in a separate `.md` file to explain the design logic and functionality clearly.

## 📁 Projects Included

- **4BitAsyncCounter** – Asynchronous 4-bit binary counter.
- **4BitBinarySynchronousCounter** – Synchronous 4-bit binary counter.
- **4bitRegister** – 4-bit register using D flip-flops.
- **4bitRippleCarryAdder** – 4-bit adder using ripple-carry logic.
- **4bitSubtractorUnsigned** – Unsigned 4-bit subtractor.
- **And_gate**, **Or_gate** – Basic logic gate implementations.
- **DflipFlop** – D-type flip-flop.
- **S7SegmentDecoder** – 7-segment display decoder.
- **Traffic_light** – Simple traffic light controller FSM.
- **hello.md** – Likely a test or sample module.
- **commn.txt** – May include general notes or comments.

## 📚 Description

Each file contains:

- A brief description of the module.
- Verilog code for the circuit.
- Testbench where applicable.
- Explanation of simulation or expected behavior.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Atomic00725/Verilog.git
